Corporate PACs are controlled by the employees of the company, not the company itself or its leadership. At some companies, corporate PACs function as a way for employees to donate in alignment w/ company leaders. The CEO of CVS, though, has given to both Republican and Democrat candidates and causes including an Obama victory fund in 2011. He's never donated to Trump. The CVS corporate PAC donates fairly evenly across the aisle in general. In the 2018 midterms it gave slightly more to Democratic candidates. The CVS story was more about one of its vendors, The Pill Club, being in a contract dispute with CVS. Pill Club is a subscription birth control service that delivers birth control and other prescriptions by mail. It appears to have used that one particular CVS PAC donation to gain leverage in its contract dispute with CVS. It speaks to the toxicity of the Trump administration that even an employee PAC that gives fairly evenly across the aisle can be implicated and Grab Your Wallet Alliance does recommend employee PACs avoid donating to pro-Trump PACs due to the risks it poses to the company's brand, however this one, in our opinion, does not rise to the level of a boycott-able concern.
